## Key Insights
1. **Survival Rates by Class:**
   - First-class passengers had a significantly higher survival rate compared to those in third class.

2. **Port of Embarkation Impact:**
   - Passengers from Cherbourg had the highest survival rate (55.4%) compared to Queenstown (38.9%) and Southampton (33.7%).

3. **Group Travel Dynamics:**
   - 134 unique tickets were shared among multiple passengers, likely representing families or groups.

4. **Cabin Assignments:**
   - Only 22.9% of passengers had assigned cabins, indicating most third-class passengers did not have designated accommodations.

5. **Fare Disparities:**
   - Passengers from Cherbourg paid the highest fares, suggesting a wealthier demographic, which contributed to higher survival rates.
